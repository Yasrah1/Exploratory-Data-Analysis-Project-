# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-
Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the amazon_sales dataset. This project is part of my ongoing Data Analysis learning journey, where I explore real-world sales data using MySQL to uncover insights, trends, and patterns.

📌 Project Overview

The dataset contains detailed sales transactions, including:

● Category and Sub-Category of products

● Sales, Profit, and Discount

● Purchase_Date

● Customer and State information

● Shipping mode

The goal of this project was to perform a thorough exploratory analysis to understand sales performance, identify trends, and practice a wide range of SQL techniques.

🛠 Tools & Techniques

● Database: MySQL

● SQL Concepts Practised:

● Aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

● Grouping (GROUP BY, HAVING)

● Conditional logic (CASE, THEN, ELSE)

● String manipulation (SUBSTRING, LIKE)

● Rolling totals & cumulative sums

● Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

● Filtering and logical operators (AND)

● Sorting and limiting results (ORDER BY, LIMIT)

📈 Key Insights

● Office Supplies dominate sales, with a few sub-categories driving most revenue.

● Some high-sales furniture products are low-profit, highlighting potential pricing or cost issues.

● Discounts vary significantly across states, affecting average profitability.

● Certain years showed peak sales, and monthly rolling totals revealed trends over time.

● Profit categorisation helps identify loss-making or highly profitable orders quickly.

💡 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my ability to:

  ● Write complex SQL queries using aggregation, filtering, and conditional logic.

  ● Analyse sales data across categories, regions, and time periods.

  ● Use advanced SQL features like CTEs, rolling totals, and CASE statements.

  ● Translate raw transactional data into actionable insights.

📂 Next Steps

● Move onto the next stage of my learning journey which would be EXCEL

● Explore joins with customer or product tables to gain more insights.

● Visualise findings using Python or Tableau to identify trends more effectively.
